## 1. Motivation
In this project, we try to anlyze a public health dataset provided originally from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments), recording the history of missing healthcare appointments for patients with various conditions. The dataset includes columns for various patient vital information, including Gender, Age and health conditions such as Hypertension, Diabetes and Alchoholism. It also includes Neighborhood and whether or not the patient is enrolled in the public welfare system in Brazil, called Bolsa Familia (called Scholarship in the dataset). It also includes the appointment date and the scheduling date, when the appointment was originally booked. Finally, the dataset also includes information on whether an SMS appointment message was recieved by the patiend or not.

## 2. Installation
For installing the project, you need to load the dataset from Kaggle, and run the project file using a Jupyter Notebook. The project requires Python 3 or above.

## 3. Files Description:
- <b>Investigate-A-Medical-Dataset.ipynb</b>: the project's main jupyter notebook.
- <b>README.md</b>: file including information on the project.

## 4. Results
The project main results can be found in this <a href="https://medium.com/@abdulrahmanalmana/some-factors-affecting-appointment-missing-in-brazil-92d54dccedcf">blog post </a>.
