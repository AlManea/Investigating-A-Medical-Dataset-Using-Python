# Investigating-A-Medical-Dataset-Using-Python
In this project, we try to anlyze a public health dataset provided originally from Kaggle, recording the history of missing healthcare appointments for patients with various conditions. The dataset includes columns for various patient vital information, including Gender, Age and health conditions such as Hypertension, Diabetes and Alchoholism. It also includes Neighborhood and whether or not the patient is enrolled in the public welfare system in Brazil, called Bolsa Familia (called Scholarship in the dataset). It also includes the appointment date and the scheduling date, when the appointment was originally booked. Finally, the dataset also includes information on whether an SMS appointment message was recieved by the patiend or not.

The analysis aims to get an insight into which factors play some role in making an appointment more susictible to be cancelled. This could be helpful in putting in some checks and measures to make sure such appointments are not going to be missed. In particular, we will try to find if there is any relationship between some patient vital and health conditions (Age, Hypertension, Diabestes and Alchoholism), the length of the duration between the scheduling day and the appointment day, the enrollment in public welfare systm,and the reciption of the SMS message on making an appointment more or less suciptible to be missed.
